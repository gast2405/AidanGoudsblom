		<h3>Ballooney is a short game for the NES. It's build using 6502 assembly using NESASM3 as a compiler. The game features a girl running after her balloon, she dodges obstacles by dodging and blowing her bubblegum to float in the air.</h3>

		<h3>The game speeds up over time rewarding you more points but making it more difficult to dodge the obstacles and using the bubblegum to float becomes neccesary. If you manage to not run into an obstacle long enough you can actually grab your balloon and get to the winning screen.</h3>

A newer version of the game (not published) also features music, sound effects and new obstacles. Occasionally red birds will fly in the sky at various heights, making it more difficult for people to time their bubblegum jump.</h3>

		<h3>This is not my first NES game i have made, i have made other projects but never published them online. A good example of this is HOUSE, a roleplaying game inspired by games like Earthbound and Undertale. In the game you would explore around your house trying to solve different puzzles to hopefully find a way to leave your house so you can play with your friends outside.</h3>
