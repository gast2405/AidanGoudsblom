Yes i kept both intestines all this time! I saved them incase i ever needed to hang myself.

I thought to myself such evil could not be kept in such body of pure foundation it must be extracted. With a scissor laying around i cut the top of my head open and had my sister pull it out. It grey two legs and tried to convince me to join its mission towards the helm but i refused.
