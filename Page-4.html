	<h3>The games central focus is on maintaining control over the board. The more Control Points you have the more cards you can play, the cost of a card depends on its rarity and if you have already played a card this turn (+2cp cost per previously played card). </h3>
	<h3>Every chesspiece has a certain value, if you take a piece you gain cp equal to that value. You can also gain cp by discarding a card in your hand for its base value cost. If the control point indicator reaches all the way to your side of the table, you have lost the game. If its all the way on the other side of the table you have won the game.</h3>
