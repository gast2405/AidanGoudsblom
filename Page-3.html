  	</div>
	
	<div class="smallborder">
		<h3>The theme of GMTK 2024 was: <em>build to scale.</em></h3>
		<h3>The robot would solve puzzles troughout the laboratory by scaling boxes and eventually himself. The basic gist of the game is that you can't pickup boxes that are bigger then you, so to be able to pick them up you would have to get them trough shrink lasers. If a box is smaller then your size then you can also throw the box.</h3>
